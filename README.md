### What's this?

This is very bare-bones templating kit created using Handlebars.js and some PHP includes. Data is stored in JSON files, and sitewide components and content reside in partials/base.php.

### To use:

1. Duplicate the 'template.php' file.
2. Rename it to your liking.
3. Duplicate the 'data/template.json' file.
4. Rename to your liking, usually the same name as the file.
5. In your new PHP file, change the ```$data_file_name``` variable to the same as your JSON file above.
6. Add your markup to the page and voila!
